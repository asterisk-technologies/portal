            </h2>
            <p>To ensure that you're the best employee for the job, our HR team goes through an extensive process, which involves checking resumes and performing a background check. This is to ensure the safety of our employees, and the productivity of the company. Considering the thoroughness of this process, it may take anywhere between 2-3 weeks to get an answer back to you, depending on the number of applicants and the job that is desired.</p>

            </h2>
            <p> A lot of our jobs here at company are remote, which gives employees the plessure to almost always work on their own schedule. In the Job offerings page, you can see which jobs are remote and which ones are not. However, all employees are required to be online at 9 AM. They can, however; based on the quantity of work that day, choose when to log off. The general time that work ends is 5 PM.</p>

            </h2>
            <p>To ensure the integrity of the work environment, we go through various extensive measures to find whether or not someone is right for the job. For example, before you can be hired we conduct finger-print tests as well as a background check. These types of precautions are necessary, as to not endanger our employees or our clients. Another process we go through is the resume checking. We proofread applications, and if applicable, we call any references listed, so that we understand the full capabilities of the applicant.</p>
